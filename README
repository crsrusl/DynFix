# DynFix

### Description
DynFix is a golang application which is used to remotely update Cloudflare DNS records.

### What's it for?
DynFix looks to replicate the functionality of the Dynamic DNS service found at [DynDNS](https://dyn.com/remote-access/), but over Cloudflare

### How does it work
- Clone this respository and update the config information
- Build the application and run on the environment which you are looking to bind to with a Cloudflare enabled domain name

DynFix will automatically update your domain name to point to your dynamic IP address, thus eliminating the need for a paid dynamic dns service.
